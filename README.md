# PingPong
C# Client-server latency tester

## Usage

1. Launch PingPing on two computers that can interact with each other through a network.
2. Choose, when asked, a client instance on computer #1 and a server instance on computer #2.
3. Enter the needed parameters on both computers.
4. The client side will send a "Ping" to the server that will respond "Pong" if everything goes fine.
5. The elapsed time is shown after that.
6. You can repeat the procedure at your will.

## But there's already "Ping"

It's just a little demo to show you how you can measure a communication latency between two computers in C#.  
No big deal.
